When addind an item to database , make sure that the fields are the way we want



Added an input onClick of changePriceBtn on displaywishList.html --> 
add a whole form with this input inside , the form should have 
a post request to an updated.ejs that will use the req.body
to render something like 'updated <%product%> to <%price%>'
Or , we could send a fetch with a put request ,
update on the database and preventDefault on the form
Btn with a delete product : form with prevent default , fetching the database and
sending a delete request to that product with that id 
remove the product with that id from the DOM 

On index.html there is an about section , make it somethingonmouseover an 
about div is displayed with info about the company.
