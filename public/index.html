      The price of products sold online may fluctuate, they may be now costing
      too much but they might eventually be on a sale and available at an
      attractive price for the next few hours only to go back to it's original
      price tomorrow.<br />
      With the Amazon Price Chacker&copy; by Fernandes Programming you can enter
      a product that you want to buy and how much do you want to pay for it and
      the app will automatically check for it's price and send you a
      notification once it's price goes bellow what you wanted it to be.
